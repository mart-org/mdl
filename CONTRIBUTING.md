# Contribute to a GitHub Project

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Go to the GitHub repository you want to contribute to and click the "Fork" button in the top right corner. This will create your own copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Repository:**
   - Clone your newly created repository to your local machine using the following command in the terminal:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/jefferson-lopez-dev/mart-dl.git
     ```

3. **Create a Branch:**
   - Create a new branch for your contribution. This helps to keep your code separate from the main project code. You can do this with the following command:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-branch-name
     ```

4. **Make Changes:**
   - Make your changes to the code. You can add new files, modify existing files, etc.

5. **Add and Commit Changes:**
   - Add the modified files using the following command:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Then, commit the changes:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
     ```

6. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   - Push your changes to your GitHub repository using the following command:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-branch-name
     ```

7. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub and switch to the branch you just pushed. Then, click the "New Pull Request" button. Provide information about your changes and create the pull request.

8. **Wait for Review:**
   - Project collaborators will review your Pull Request. You may need to make additional changes based on their feedback.

9. **Update Your Local Branch (if necessary):**
   - If collaborators make changes to the main branch while you're waiting for the review, you should update your local branch with these changes:
     ```bash
     git pull origin your-branch-name
     ```

10. **Repeat the Process:**
    - Make adjustments according to the reviews and repeat the process until your Pull Request is accepted.

That's essentially it! Make sure to follow the project's and GitHub's recommended practices.
